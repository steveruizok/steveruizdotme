				<p>My name is Stephen Ruiz, and Iâ€™m a designer who codes. My background is in visual art and I like to design for user interactions on web and mobile. I made this site to show you <b>Cycle Map</b>, a mobile application prototype I built in <a href="https://framer.com/" alt="Framer Studio">Framer Studio</a>. The full prototype can be explored <a href="https://framer.cloud/cnuRj" alt="Cycle Map Framer Prototype">here.</a></p>
				<p>I designed and built Cycle Map in several iterations, using Framer Studio to code the interactions and animations and Sketch for all visual assets. On the next few pages, I've put up a <a href="/cyclemap.html" alt="Cycle Map Demo">step by step</a> tour of the features I built in the prototype. And of course, as this is a presentation both of the product and of how I work, I've <a href="/cyclemapdesign.php" alt="Design">documented the entire design process</a>, from early sketches to final prototype.</p>

				<p>If you like the project or are interested in working together, <a href="#contact" alt="Contact">please let me know</a>.</p>
				<p><b>Background</b></p>
				<p>I was inspired to design Cycle Map by <a href="http://cycle.travel/map" alt="Cycle.Travel">cycle.travel</a>, an excellent journey planner for cyclists, edited by Richard Fairhurst with site design by <a href="http://www.simonclayson.co.uk/" alt="Simon Clayson Design">Simon Clayson Design</a>. I am not affiliated with either organization, except as a user of the cycle.travel site. As cycle.travel does not yet have a mobile application, I took a shot at designing one myself, interested in the challenges presented by such an application and, as a cyclist myself, already familiar with some of the user needs.</p>
				<p><b>This Website</b></p>
				<p>To show the project off, I also prototyped, designed and built this website using jQuery, Bootstrap, and a little PHP.</p>
				<p><b>And Finally...</b></p>
				<p> I'm looking for a career in the field of user interface/interaction design, so please <a href="#contact" alt="Contact">let me know</a> if you're interested in this project or want to discuss any opportunities to do this kind of thing during daylight hours.</p>
